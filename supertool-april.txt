  If you have questions about what the Stanley numbers are, you can
look the planes up on Blood&Gore:

  Sometimes, emails to/from me are vectored to some cyber black
hole, never reaching their destination. I answer all emails, so if
you haven't heard from me, your/my email is likely having high tea
in said black hole, never to be heard from, so please try again.

  If there is anything in particular that you're after, do ping me
as there is a lot of stuff here that isn't on the list; the list
just represents a snapshot of the previous month's haul with none
of the stuff having appeared on a previous list. I like to keep
things fresh here.

  Please email me prior to sending money so that you can be sure
the item is still up for grabs. Also, prices do not include shipping,
which is the amount that it takes to go from me to you via the US
Post Office.

  This list goes out to many people, normally on the first Monday
of the month (unless otherwise noted above). So, if you see something
you want, it's the quickest finger on the trigger that wins the duel.

  Some folks become upset that they miss out on a tool. I wish I had
lots of this stuff many times over so I can satisfy the demand, but 
that is normally not the case. Some of it does have duplicates here,
and if so, I will state that in my reply to you.

  Also, due to the nature of selling over the wires, tools are s#65old
on a first come, first serve basis. The first person to say "I'll 
take it", gets it. I have to operate this way as some will take a 
few days to get back to me with their interest in a particular item,
and it's unfair to keep others waiting who are willing to buy the
item immediately.

  I reserve the right to correct typographical errors after the list
goes out. I rarely make them, but when I do they can be major ones.

  If you're the kind of person who puts a straightedge to the sole of
a #40, to check it for flatness, or who tosses a plane on a scale to
weight it against what it states in the Stanley catalogs, you'll need
to take your business elsewhere. I'll wish you luck finding perfection
in something that was never made, nor intended to be, perfect. You guys
know who you are, and it's best for both of us that our paths not cross.

  Lastly, and I don't like to mention this, but if you tell me that 
money is on the way for something you want, and you never make good
on it, we won't be doing business in the future. It's unfair, actually
downright discourteous, to others who want the same thing, and I tell
them it's sold. Pull this on me, and you're exorcised from the list.
Sorry, but I don't tolerate this behavior well at all.

  Don't forget the cool new tools that I'm making - a jazzy layout
knife being used by professionals (made the cover of Feb.1998 FWW!),
a detachable block plane handle designed to fit your standard pitch
block planes, a killer Robinson's Improved Patent sliding bevel, a
tilting jaw for your Emmert's vise, and the finest bench plane in 
production today, the Bed Rock #601. You can see it all at:

  Remember, you don't have to be a connoisseur (did I spell that
correctly) to shop here. You can be a wirehead, a metalhead, a zipper-
head, a propellerhead, a deadhead, a cokehead, or even a knuckle
dragging oaf, just like me, to shop here, as long as your dinero is
green.

  Thanks for shopping, and remember that no letters or words were 
injured when writing this list...


  FEATURED TOOL OF THE MONTH
  ******** **** ** *** *****

  FT1  After overdosing on chocolate eggs and bunny rabbets on
       Easter, tool model took a moment to display a unique 
       patented plane that he selected from the Inner Sanctum
       (he'd rather have an Auburn 827), a prototype Steer's
       Patent smoothing plane; a significant and unique model
       that seems to bridge the transition from Steere and
       Long's patent to the Steere's (alone) patent, it has
       features of both, but is unique in its own right; a
       #4 size plane, it has a sliding sole section set by 
       loosening the knob and a telescoping adjustment to set
       the iron's pitch, both these are features of the Steere
       and Long's patent; the plane also has perforated iron
       to accept the cutter's adjustment, the sole is machined
       to accept wooden inserts, both these are features of
       the later Steere's effort; unique to the plane is a 
       laminated tote; perhaps a patent model, the plane was
       never fit with the wooden inserts, it looks to be unused,
       and is in fine shape; there are no markings of any kind 
       on it; a great plane for those into the grand 
       experiments in plane development:

  ST51 Type 1 #9 3/4 block plane; all original parts, and as
       found, with a very minor area of roughness on the back
       edge of the mouth (most have hideous chips) it's difficult
       for most to believe that this is how their trusty #9 1/2
       block plane's body looked like 125 years ago; a nice
       example that should be left as it is, it's rarely found
       today in an undisturbed condition; bottom:

       circus, where competition was eating them alive with lower

       an earlier box, the plane looks to be unused, an area of

       series, it centers the groove on 3/8" thick stock, the
       plane can work 1/4" to 1/2" thick stock; free of damage,
       with expected plating loss, this style plane replaced
       the #48/#49 design likely due to easier manufacturing,
       each does a good job of cutting the useful tongue and
       groove joint; top:

       the longest folding rule in Stanley's seemingly endless
       lineup of rules, it's perfect for larger work, they aimed

       is missing on the exterior, a bit of oil will do it wonders;
       owner scratched initials on the interior, alignment pins

       the smaller #40 does by backing the blade off a bit so that

  ST106 Stanley 150th Anniversary transitional plane in the
        original box and with packing paper; 2000 of these were
        supposed to be made, but the person buying the planes for
        Stanley couldn't supply that many, this is number 221; I
        remember when the buyer was snapping these things up at
        tool sales, everyone was perplexed over why, I thought 
        he lost the plot; only later did the secret get out, and
        the skyrocketing prices (by about $10 more than usual)
        burst, as all bubbles do, the glut of transitionals soon 
        found their best use, as a source of heat; top:

  ST109 Complete run of the short-lived Stanley Tool Collector
        News along with a bumper sticker to put on the toolmobile
        you use when hunting rust; published by John Walter after
        his price guide was printed, the info contained takes a
        more detailed look at Stanley stuff as it became known
        post-printing of the price guide; nineteen issues, it 
        went extinct 1996; left:

  ST110 #144 3/8" radius plane; the most common of the odd-looking
        series of planes that are designed to plane a fixed radius
        along an edge; all three original parts, no damage, the
        japanning is about 50%; embossed with the patent date;

  WOOD PLANES
  **** ******

  WP1  No.6 hollow and rounds by J.M.Taber of New Bedford; in
       sound worker shape, always together, from a fine maker,
       no rework, some dried paint, owner mark; top left:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t8.jpg             $85.00
  WP2  Same as previous, but No.8 size; top right:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t8.jpg             $85.00
  WP3  Moving fillister by Ulmia; the German version of a popular
       adjustable plane used to cut rabbets; with hornbeam sole,
       it has full length adjustable fence and stop, nicker iron,
       and skewed main iron, that one is replace and needs to be
       ground straight; a fine quality plane; top left:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t14.jpg           $110.00
  WP4  Ulmia toothing plane; with the horn grip, hornbeam sole,
       in sound worker shape, it's a versatile plane for all 
       sorts of wood preparation; top right:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t14.jpg            $60.00
  WP5  Horned scrub plane; with a 1 1/4" wide iron ground with a
       radius, it's the German version of a #40 1/2 scrub plane,
       but with a wooden body; never used, in the original box,
       all it needs is a honing; bottom:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t14.jpg            $65.00
  WP6  Moving fillister with boxed shoulder, boxwood wedge, and
       screwed depth stop; as found and free of alteration, it
       has the notched fence for removing the iron without having
       to remove a screw on the fence; perfect for cutting rabbets
       in any grain direction, it's the wooden plane of choice 
       for that task; dry surface, owner mark, the boxwood behind
       the iron will need some tlc as it's warped a bit, it's not
       terminal, making this one price less than the usual examples;
       bottom:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t18.jpg           $125.00
  WP7  Clean Marples wedge arm plough with matching set of eight
       irons; little used, always together, in ready to use
       condition (after irons are honed), the wedge was planed
       just a bit to sit lower in the mortice, the original owner
       likely did that to suit his grip:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t22.jpg           $190.00
  WP8  Graduated and matching set of ten beading planes by
       Varvill; always together, same owner mark, never cleaned,
       with minor modification of the heel having the sharp 
       corners rounded (for comfortable grip), expected knocks
       and dings; diameters of 1/8", 3/16, 1/4", 5/16", 3/8", 
       1/2", 5/8", 3/4", 7/8", and 1", sets this numerous are
       not easy to find:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t23.jpg           $290.00
  WP9  Odd, double struck J.Killam quirked ovolo and astragal;
       Mr.Killam must have been trying out his new stamp as the
       plane has both his old and new stamps for the maker's
       mark; a fine, never mucked with example, free of owner
       marks, it's sized to work 3/4" thick stock; Killam was
       an early 19th century maker from Glastonbury, CT, he 
       made nice stuff; both stamps are straight line, one of
       them is not in AWP;
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t26.jpg           $145.00
  WP10 Same as previous (came with previous), it also has the
       two stamps in it; a good quirked ogee and astragal for
       3/8" thick stock, there's a bit of minor roughness at 
       the toe that in now way detracts from this example that
       has never been altered or cleaned:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t27.jpg           $145.00
  WP11 Preston (EP logo) 1/2" Roman ogee; a clean and sound
       example by a firm that made more tools than all other
       makers in the world combined (or so it seems); a perfect
       size for cabinetwork, the Roman ogee has unlimited uses;
       a couple nail holes in the bottom of the fence (for a 
       shim) have no bearing on its use:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t28.jpg            $85.00
  WP12 Pair of clean side rabbets by Varvill; as nice as they 
       come, lightly cleaned, with owner mark, all they need is 
       a honing; top left:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t37.jpg           $145.00
  WP13 1" skew rabbet; barely used, no maker's mark, manufactured
       and likely English, all it needs is a honing; top right:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t37.jpg            $60.00
  WP14 6" smoothing plane by Marples; still with decal, barely
       use, single iron, perfect for smoothing smaller stuff or
       planing localized difficult areas of grain; bottom:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t37.jpg            $55.00
  WP15 Three smaller smoothing plane sized special purpose planes,
       typical of coachmakers; by C.Nurse, barely used, 6 1/2"
       long, one is a flat sole smoother, one a convex hollowing,
       the other a concave rounding; fine quality, all they need
       is a honing, each is fit with a double iron; top three:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t38.jpg           $125.00
  WP16 Half-set of odd numbered skewed hollow and rounds by John
       Moseley; a fine worker set, the planes were barely used
       and then left to sit idle, two went missing, non-skewed
       replacements were added by me; sizes 1 through 17, they
       will compliment well your even numbered set, you'll see
       about 100 of those before you see an odd-numbered set,
       Moseley was a common maker, finding the two replacements
       by Moseley is definitely possible (if you care):
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t73.jpg           $775.00
  WP17 Clean 3/4" Roman ogee; little used and free of alteration,
       perfect size for today's stock thickness, it's manu-
       factured but with no maker's mark:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t76.jpg            $75.00
  WP18 Wooden grooving plane, the wood plane version of the Record
       043; unused, it's perfect for lighter work on boxes and
       drawers; all original parts, cutter widths of 1/8", 3/16",
       and 1/4"; adjustable fence is like those on a moving 
       fillister; bottom left:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t80.jpg           $115.00
  WP19 Ohio Tool Co. Gothic bead and follow, their model number
       67; larger size, the profile measures 3/4" across to the
       extremes of the fillets; in fine and little used condition,
       the Gothic revival was a short-lived period that swept
       America during the mid-19th century, the midwest seemed
       to have adopted the style with open arms while the snobby
       easterners gravitated to the Italianate (and others);
       double iron, later auxiliary fence added, that can easily
       be removed:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t83.jpg           $185.00
  WP20 C.R.Wells double iron sash; cuts the classic square ovolo
       pattern, the plane is as found, unmodified, no owner marks,
       with original surfaces, a bit of staining on the right
       cheek; a very nice example by this earlier New York maker
       who is part of the Wells family of planemakers;
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t84.jpg           $155.00
  WP21 W.Webb/Pittsfield adjustable sash plane; working in the
       far west of Massachusetts, it's easy to see the Albany
       influence on this plane with the diamond brass plating
       through which the adjusting screws are mounted; with 
       lignum boxing, an odd choice for mid-1800's New England
       planemakers; in sound condition, cleaned, owner initials,
       it cuts a larger square ovolo; Webb's planes are not
       common:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t85.jpg

  WP22 Gladwin&Appleton 1/4" fully boxed double bead; designed 
       to work with and against the grain, and both edges of
       the work, the plane is in sound worker shape, there's no
       cracks in the boxwood, the body has shrunk a small
       amount around the boxing, that has no bearing on its
       use; good size for cabinet work, owner initials, lightly
       cleaned:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t86.jpg           $140.00
  WP23 Dated 1878 and carved scrub plane; the horn being carved
       with subtle details, directly behind is the date and the
       creator's name of Johann Kostler; 10 1/4" long, the sole
       is slightly convex, suiting it well for scrub work; in
       solid, as found condition; bottom:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t89.jpg
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t89a.jpg          $155.00
  WP24 Pair of little used snipe bills by Moseley; always together
       and in far nicer than usual condition, owner mark, one
       has a ding in the boxing at toe and heel (next to impossible
       to find them perfect), all they need is a honing; top two:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t138.jpg          $190.00
  WP25 Odd Gleave/Manchester special purpose plane with vertically
       pitch iron that cuts a small quarter round along its right
       side; no doubt, the plane is designed to fit within a 
       narrow and deep groove, it may be used to undercut moldings
       formed with hollows/rounds or have been used for some type
       of coping work; in little used condition, there is some
       roughness along the right edge of the 'sole', that seems
       inevitable due to the small amount of material there; owner
       mark, I had a similar user-made one several months ago,
       this is the first I've seen by a manufacturer; you'll like
       this if you're into odd wooden planes; bottom:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t138.jpg          $135.00
  WP26 Decorative double iron plane that can be separated to make
       to curved rabbet planes; a fairly recent make, it has a
       left and right iron to work a cove, the irons and wedges
       have nice work to them; the two pieces screwed together
       allow the plane to work a hollow; 4" long, unused, a lot
       of work was put into this one; bottom left:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t141.jpg

  WP27 7/8" (depth of cut) cove and astragal by J.Killam; a fine
       example of this versatile plane that saw little use, there
       is still some original inked writing on the toe; free of
       damage, and alteration, with owner mark:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t143.jpg          $125.00
  WP28 3/4" (depth of cut) square, cove, and square by C.Butler
       of Philadelphia; never messed with, lightly used, original
       surface, no owner marks, and an uncommon profile that's
       perfect for today's standard stock thickness:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t144.jpg          $145.00
  WP29 7/8" (width of cut) Brown&Barnard astragal; as found, 
       barely used, with original inking on heel, owner mark, 
       a good worker made during the early 1800's:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t145.jpg           $70.00
  WP30 5/8" (depth of cut) quirked Grecian ovolo by J.&J.Gibson of
       Albany, a rather uncommon maker's mark; as found, never
       modified or cleaned, small chip at heel of boxing and a 
       small wear area at corner of nose; good proportions:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t146.jpg           $95.00
  WP31 7/8" (depth of cut) reverse ogee and astragal by T.Tileston
       of Boston; one of my favorite profiles, this is a sound
       example of a plane that saw little use, the wedge finial
       long ago sheared off and then was neatly repaired by its
       owner; no owner's marks, it's a fine looking and working
       plane from ca.1825:
          http://www.supertool.com/forsale/apr/t147.jpg          $125.00
  WP32 1/2" (depth of cut) quirk ovolo and astragal by Williams
       of New York; as found, it saw use and has plenty of life
       left in it despite what the photo suggests; dirty from
       sitting idle, wedge replaced a long time ago, ancient
       shavings in the mouth, this will clean to be a much nicer
       looking plane than it currently is:

       shoulders, it's work is not limited to stair stringers;
       as found, sound worker shape, hang hole at front grip,

  MS6  3" slick with original turned handle by Ohio Tool Co.; in
       cleaner than usual condition, most of the original glazing
       remains, with expected tarnish spots, it's free of the 
       common pitting found on such tools; bevel has a corner 
       chip, it'll need a regrinding; fine quality, laminated
       steel construction; middle:

       3/4", 7/8", 1", 1 1/4", 1 1/2", 1 3/4", and 2"; you can't

       looks to be by Marples, the other two are Taylor's, a 1/4"
       No.16 and a 5/16" No.20; in clean and sound worker shape;
       a fourth skew is tossed in for free as a surprise, it 
       didn't make it in time for the photo; left:

  MS10 Owner-made lignum mallet; 5" diameter, in solid worker
       shape, good mass, the wood has voids, which is probably
       a good thing lest you develop tendonitis from swinging 
       such a heavy thing; right:

       with an owner made wooden guard, this is a nice as found
       worker, the top horn has a chip off it, there are several
       owner marks stamped in the handle; not your usual dog of
       an example, someone loved this one with much finer than 
       usual teeth; bottom:

  MS12 Good Jennings pattern auger set as made by C.E.Jennings;
       great quality, these are Jennings' best brand with the
       arrow mark, they saw little used and are in their original
       hinged wooden box; diameters 1/4" to 1", they fit the 
       common braces on this list; left:

  MS13 Ohio Tool Co. 02 smoothing plane; their version of the 
       Stanley #2, Ohio Tool copied Stanley's almost the entire
       product line and offered their stuff for less money; the
       maroon finish model with rosewood tote, the knob looks to
       be mahogany and of the kind Sargent supplied, the finish
       looks to be nearly all there but has dulled; small splinter
       off edge of rosewood tote, original thick laminated steel
       iron (a plus for this company as they went all out on the
       irons), it's a decent example of a plane that's far less
       common than Stanley's; right:

  MS14 Low angle #60 1/2 style block plane as made by Millers
       Falls; a fine quality product, their model No.56, with

       needs a honing; has a long machined bed; top left:

  MS15 Spoke pointer; a good worker that can turn up to 2" diameter,
       it cuts a conical shape on the end of wood in preparation
       of the hollow auger; fits all common braces; it's a A.A.
       Woods' model, stamped that on the shank, and is a different
       than typical configuration by that firm; top right:

  MS79 Crazy infill smoothing plane with hideous stuffing but a
       great casting and pierced lever cap; lots of curves to the
       side rails, the lever cap has a club-shape piercing; oddly,
       the maker of this one chose to add rather ugly stuffing,
       someone later finished the job by adding a turned knob;
       lever cap screw is a bolt with a rod through it, this 
       plane can be transformed into a thing of beauty only

  MS84 Rare Hunter's Patent carriagemaker's plane; patented in
       1906 by Robert Hunter, of Spokane, WA, the inventor
       probably spent more time hunting for customers than he
       ever did making these as they are most uncommon; Hunter
       purchased Stanley #10 jack rabbets and retrofit them 
       with his tilting handle; well made, and done so prior to
       Stanley offering the #10 1/4, it seems likely that 
       Hunter's idea prompted Stanley to make the #10 1/4 and
       once that happened, Hunter was just another trophy hung
       in Stanley's boardroom as tribute to wholesale slaughter
       of various tool species; bottom:

       desired angle; the face of the casting has shallow diagonal

  MS99 Unique #9 1/2 style block plane with Masonic adorned brass
       lever cap; obviously inspired by the excelsior model of
       the Stanley #9 1/2, it uses a similar adjustment nut to 
       set the cutter, though rather crudely at that; a detailed
       lever cap has a hollow in its back to engage a screw, a
       lever is rotated to lock it in place; never cleaned, great
       patina, fine detail to the lever cap, it's missing the 
       front knob, perhaps that was sacrificed during some unknown
       Masonic ritual, the plane is nevertheless extra jazzy, 
       there's not another one like it, that's why it was accepted
       (with much fanfare) into the Inner Sanctum; right:

  MS100 Great cast mini-router with decorative scrolled casting;
        owner made, it's as nice as anything manufactured, the
        anonymous maker of this one had was as much an artist as
        he was a toolmaker; a brass collar holds the cutter to 
        the post that arises from the 6 1/2" long casting, a brass
        vernier adjustment nut is slotted to accept a fork forged
        on the cutter; no doubt earlier than the Stanley router,
        the same adjustment was adopted by Stanley years after
        they debuted their router; turned wooden knobs, one was
        split and glued, this one is ex-Inner Sanctum, it's one

  MS106 Unique Davidson's Patent smoothing plane; at first glance
        this looks like an owner made plane, but it's identical
        to patent number 696,414 issued on April 1, 1902; 
        Davidson, of Port Chester, NY still held firm to the
        belief that a combination of metal and wood was the best
        solution for a smoothing plane, he went a bit farther by
        specifying that the sole be a composite of the two
        materials, but in this case bone is inlaid into the sole;
        reading the patent specification reveals just how foolish
        Davidson was, his date of patent certainly confirmed that;
        the only known example of which I'm aware, the plane is
        one of the few that match the patent drawing exactly, 
        even the wedge profile is identical; as found, missing
        the knob, not a mark of any kind on it, it was dumb luck
        that I found this one in the patent records; a plane 
        that shouldn't have been made, and that's no joke; ex
        Inner Sanctum:

  MS107 Unique Katz Patent smoothing plane, perhaps the patent
        model; while a few other Katz Patents are known, none
        are like this laminated example that has bone strips
        applied to the sole; stamped in the toe with Katz's
        name, and date, albeit both lightly so, this plane was
        doomed to fail while on the drawing board (or more 
        likely when floating around in Katz's head); patent
        number 102,406, issued on April 26, 1870, this plane
        resembles the drawings more than the one in PTAMPIA-II,
        the specification calls for the laminated strips that
        this one has; the plane has the adjustable mouth like
        the other known example, but the specification is for
        the sole; in fact, the entire plane is laminated with
        the body being rosewood and held together with bone
        pins; Katz was from Cincinnati, this plane was sold 
        at an Ohio auction where the late Ron Pearson (of
        brace frame) engaged me in a slugfest to own it; an ugly,
        yet significant, plane for those who are fascinated
        with the twisted and torturous path how a chisel 
        ultimately became a Veritas over the millennia: another
        ex Inner Sanctum:

  MS108 Another unique (as far as I know) patented plane, the
        Foster's Patent; Philander Foster, of Richmond, ME came
        up with this idea January 26, 1869, perhaps during the
        bleak and cold winter that would drive any sane man
        nuts (remember, Steven King is from Maine and he gave us
        The Shining); that, or black fly season, initiated this
        mad idea, where the plane body is two sections secured
        along the sides with brass plates, the front section 
        capable of being moved forward/backward to set the
        mouth's width; sounds good, but it didn't work, someone
        should have slapped Philander a few times to knock some
        sense into him before following his nightmare come to
        life; stamped in the toe "THE FOSTER PLANE" over the
        patent date (last digit isn't readable), the plane is
        fairly well made and with good mass; ex Inner Sanctum,
        there's some staining around the mouth, perhaps Philander
        used it as ballast to keep a lobster pot from moving
        during rough seas; this, and the previous two planes,
        illustrate perfectly that no idea was too stupid to
        patent, and then make, during a time when anything was
        possible in America:

  MS114 Rare A.Stanley patent brace; first I've seen, I didn't
        recognize it when writing the list so put it in the
        miscellaneous section before flipping through Pearson's
        book on braces; patented March 30, 1869, it's from the
        very earliest days of Stanley, made before the firm
        acquired Leonard Bailey's line of planes; a simple thing,
        with a spring-loaded lever to secure the bit, there
        were so many other brace designs that functioned much
        better that this one was doomed from the start; in usual
        brace condition, it has an iron head which looks original
        to me (patent calls for a wooden head), it has a peened
        construction to secure the head on the frame; chuck still
        works, the brace is easy to mistake for an owner-made 
        thing as it's so lackluster in appearance; bottom:

  MS115 Clean Goodell-Pratt No.4 eggbeater drill with nickel 
        plated magazine to hold the drill points (some still
        present); with the 1895 patent date stamped on the
        three jaw chuck, it's as close to new condition as one
        can hope to find; best quality, and a fine worker;

  MS116 Great 6" sweep brace by Peck, Stow & Wilcox; as new as 
        they come, with lovely contrasting color for the head
        and grip, perfect working order, full ratchet, it has 
        the large jaws that extend out from the shell; perfect
        for the finest work and for those who demand the best
        and cleanest pre-WWI tools; bottom:

  MS117 Strange drill/brace with unique ratcheting mechanism
        driven by a rotating lever; this thing is a first for
        me, it's definitely manufactured, but not a maker's
        mark can be found on it; has a standard two-jaw chuck
        and shell to accept augers, when the lever is lowered
        it drives the auger into the wood; rotating the lever
        to either side controls the left or right ratchet;
        exotic wood head is capped with plated metal, it's
        designed to rotate 360 degrees to function as the
        head of a common brace; 10" long, fully operable, 
        most finish remains, an area of corrosion on the lever,
        a few dings in the cap; the closeup of the mechanism
        is a bit blurry, but shows enough detail about how 
        this thing works; top left:

        complete and original; made in Germany, the brace fits

  MS123 Wildly carved wooden router; a design that seems to have
        been manufactured as similar have appeared in the tool
        world every now and then, each with the floral carving 
        on an identical body; American-made, with a lot of work
        put into it, 15" long, good patina, a stable check to 
        the left of the cutter was secured with a countersunk
        screw, it obviously was the pride and joy of the owner
        who stamped his name to either side of the cutter; three
        screw holes in the sole from when a fence was added; a
        picture is worth a thousand words with this graphic tool;

        that the tool can be rotated 90 degrees when selecting
        which to use; in sound shape, fine quality of A.A.Wood
        (made the best hollow auger), all it needs is a honing;

        saw, the original label calls it a boy's saw; 50% of 
        that remains, the original dry finish is present, the
        13" blade is original; designed as a functioning tool,
        such boy's toys are now outlawed by 38 separate alpha-
        bet Federal agencies, each armed with their own SWAT
        teams all to protect junior for cutting himself; oh
        for the days of my Mattel Vac-u-form, Creepy Crawlers,

  MS127 Embossed shingling/carpenter's hatchet by the Duluth, MN
        firm of Kelley-How-Thomson Co.; with a maple leaf at the

  MS130 Derlon's Patent corner brace; the best example I've owned
        or seen, with most of the nickel plating; stamped with

        awarded a US patent for his clever design, he no doubt
        knew that financial opportunity was better in the US,

        handtool use was waning, which resulted in it not selling

        lineup and were supplied mostly by their New Haven

        is embossed with the Winchester name; as found, in sound
        shape, narrowest of the series, the design is better
        than Stanley's as it has a horn to grip and uses three
        lobe spurs; the Winchester models of the plane are much

        tote, to find this model plane in this condition is very,
        very difficult, some original finish remains, a bit of
        staining at the mouth; top:

  MS158 Extra long millwright's framing chisel by D.R.Barton;
        1 1/2" width, 18" long from edge to top of socket, this
        beast makes wood run for cover just being within a one
        mile radius of it; original steel hoop handle, an old
        splinter runs the length of that, the metal is free of
        pitting and retains a good amount of luster; owner mark,
        in remarkable shape for such a tool; bottom:

        box; made in Seymour, CT, no one made nicer tools than
        Swam, the body is graduated to common increment, it works

        rarely found in such condition; right:

  MS160 Simonds No.342 cross cut saw tool; the jointer, saw set,
        spider, original instructions, and box remnants, this
        tool is used to doctor the long two man saws common to
        the lumber trade, those saws once longing for love are
        now very popular, this tool is mandatory to keep them
        cutting as fast as your Husqvarna; left:

  MS161 Chaplin's Patent 26" transitional jointer; incorporating
        the adjustment features of the very popular metallic 
        models, for some reason the transitional version never
        sold well, with those showing up often being in wretched
        shape; this one escaped misuse, has all original parts,
        including the often missing small cap iron that's secured
        to the iron; grungy surface adds to its appeal, an 
        uncommon plane in a most uncommon length; bottom:

  MS165 L.L.Davis mantle clock inclinometer; a worthy candidate
        for restoration, it's missing the top screw; no damage,
        never cleaned, most of the gold highlighting remains in
        the cove, original pointer present; a good one to replace
        the broken one barking at you in the back of your

  MS168 J.Flint/Rochester (NY) brass back 14" tenon saw; as 
        found, the spine is cocked on the blade (done deliberately
        by a user), one split nut screw replaced, horns show the
        usual chipping; one of the less common NY sawmakers, it's
        a worthy candidate for restoration; top:

  MS169 Unusual machinist's made level; resembling a similar
        Starrett product, this 13" long tool has a brass level,
        similar to those used on straightedges, with an adjusting
        screw at each end; a sliding reference point is dovetailed

  MS170 Goodell-Pratt No.115 bench grinder; if it spins, GP made
        it and made it better than anyone else, such is the case
        with this solid worker that has large gears to drive the
        wheel (if you have a beard, be careful!); as found, with
        original rests, it'll clean to make a great worker; you 
        can also make money with this one by standing on a street
        corner with a tethered monkey, tin can in his hand, 
        collecting money as people gaze in amazement, hypnotized 
        by the spinning gears; left:

  MS171 Complete, and with original instructions, Hawkeye Rope
        Machine; a four strand model, made in Cedar Rapids before
        the firm relocated to Minneapolis; with original wrench, 
        no damage, in far nicer than usual condition, it may have
        been used once or twice and then its original owner either
        died or decided to buy his rope at his local farm supply;
        these things actually work, if you're into Dual Survivor 
        or a prepper, this one's for you; normally found beat up
        and/or broken, it would be difficult to find a cleaneer
        example; right:

  MS172 Preston No.2500P router with adjustable fences and two
        cutters; an engineering marvel, one of the most complex
        manufactured routers, the handles can be swapped with 
        the cutter's position to create a tool that can be
        configured three ways; adjustable stop, the fences can
        be slid along the width of the tool and can be removed
        for the times they aren't need (when that was done in
        the past, most became lost); in sound worker shape, 
        nicely cleaned, and not a common tool to find; top:

  MS173 Rosewood handle strap hammer; a fine example of a tool
        that was likely manufactured by Wynn or Timmons, such
        a tool was supplied in tool rolls retailed by Marples,
        et al; this one stamped "ENGLISH MAKE", it's in fine
        shape, and hasn't had the claws ground back like so 
        many have suffered; 6 3/4" long, there's an area of 
        loss/roughness at the bottom of the turning; bottom

  MS174 Miniature French advertising anvil; a nicely made thing
        that measures 3 1/2" along the top, there's French wording
        cast into it, I don't have a toolsetta stone handy to 
        translate it; in sound shape, made as a working tool, 
        classic French shape, it's a good size for cracking
        snail shells on using the previous item; bottom right:

  MS175 Unused ebony handle try square with perfectly blued 12"
        blade; in impossible to find condition, this is how your
        favorite Sheffield-made try square looked when it left
        that gritty old city; retailed by Lace&Co of Wigan,
        there isn't an owner's mark anywhere on it or near it; a
        high quality example that's much too nice to use; top:

  MS176 Odd special purpose grooving plane with integral squirrel
        tail handle and adjustable fence; deemed unique by a 
        very knowledgeable UK tool collector (who is patiently
        waiting for his Lordship degree to arrive by Royal Mail
        but after Her Majesty sorts the Malvinas problem) this
        8 1/2" long plane has an adjustable 1/8" iron that is set
        by turning a spring-loaded screw (small bend to that);
        perhaps used for inlay work, the plane is embossed "BRITISH
        MADE" and with a provisional patent; a strange one, indeed,
        in the timeless 'peerage' of UK tools what only they 
        could love; bottom:

  MS177 Unique owner-made chariot plane with dovetailed wooden
        body and screwed steel sole; perplexed whether to list it
        with wooden planes or here, the plane is a hybrid of
        fine planemaking, with everything but the sole and iron
        made of wood; the toe and heel are finely dovetailed to
        the sides, the four pieces are two species of wood, one
        looking like walnut, the other possible boxwood; with a
        mahogany wedge secured under an ebony bridge that has
        a double cupid's bow detail worked on it; a finely made
        plane by a forgotten master craftsman, the details and
        design of this 5 1/4" long work of art are legacy enough;
        extra thick snecked iron by Marples; a great plane; top:

        can rotate to reveal the level; brass faux iron, owner
        mark on each side, dates ca.1950, it's a great little
        thing; bottom right:

        best book ever published on the topic; loads of text,

  MS180 Unusual combination bevel and level made by George Philip
        and Son of London; makers of scientific instruments, this
        is the first of this odd tool that has a level vial along
        the top edge, with a protractor over which a blade swings;
        two tapped brass bits for mounting on a staff, the maker's
        brass plaque is applied on the side; as found, never
